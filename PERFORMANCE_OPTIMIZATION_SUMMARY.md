# Performance Optimization Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Webpack Configuration Warning
**Issue**: Warning about Webpack being configured while Turbopack is not, which may cause problems.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `next.config.ts` to include Turbopack-specific configurations
- Added conditional webpack configuration that only applies to production builds
- Created separate dev scripts for regular and Turbopack modes

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// Added Turbopack configuration
experimental: {
  turbo: {
    rules: {
      '*.svg': {
        loaders: ['@svgr/webpack'],
        as: '*.js',
      },
    },
  },
}

// Conditional webpack configuration
webpack: (config, { isServer, dev }) => {
  if (!isServer && !dev) {
    // Only apply webpack config for production builds
  }
}
```

### 2. Long Compilation Times
**Issue**: Middleware and pages taking a long time to compile (13.7s for login page).

**Solutions**:
- Optimized middleware logic to reduce unnecessary token checks
- Removed excessive console.log statements from auth callbacks
- Added early returns for public routes to avoid token validation
- Created cache clearing optimization script

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// Optimized middleware flow
export async function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  const path = req.nextUrl.pathname;
  
  // Early return for public pages
  if (isPublicPage) {
    return NextResponse.next();
  }
  
  // Only check token for protected routes
  const token = await getToken({ req, secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET });
}
```

### 3. Development Script Optimization
**Issue**: Using Turbopack with conflicting webpack configurations.

**Solution**:
- Created separate scripts for regular and Turbopack development
- Added optimization script to clear caches
- Updated package.json scripts

**New Scripts**:
```json
{
  "dev": "cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=\"--max-old-space-size=8192\" next dev",
  "dev:turbo": "cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=\"--max-old-space-size=8192\" next dev --turbopack",
  "optimize": "node scripts/optimize-dev.js"
}
```

### 4. Auth Performance Improvements
**Issue**: Excessive database queries and console logging in auth callbacks.

**Solution**:
- Removed unnecessary console.log statements
- Optimized JWT callback to only fetch from DB when needed
- Improved error handling and reduced redundant operations

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// Only fetch from DB if we have email but missing user data
if (t.email && (!t.uName || !t.role || !t.image || !t.id)) {
  // Database query only when necessary
}
```

## New Files Created

### 1. `scripts/optimize-dev.js`
- Clears Next.js cache (.next directory)
- Clears TypeScript cache (tsconfig.tsbuildinfo)
- Clears node_modules cache
- Windows-compatible file system operations

### 2. `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md`
- This documentation file

## Performance Improvements Expected

1. **Faster Initial Compilation**: Reduced middleware complexity and optimized auth flow
2. **Reduced Memory Usage**: Conditional webpack configuration and optimized imports
3. **Better Development Experience**: Separate scripts for different development modes
4. **Cache Management**: Easy cache clearing with optimization script

## Usage Instructions

### For Regular Development:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### For Turbopack Development:
```bash
npm run dev:turbo
```

### To Clear Caches and Optimize:
```bash
npm run optimize
```

### For Production Build:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Monitoring Performance

To monitor the improvements:
1. Check compilation times in terminal output
2. Monitor memory usage during development
3. Verify that the Webpack warning is resolved
4. Test authentication flow performance

## Notes

- The changes maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- All authentication flows remain intact
- Database queries are optimized but not removed
- Error handling is preserved

## Next Steps

1. Test the development server with the new configuration
2. Monitor performance metrics
3. Consider implementing additional optimizations if needed
4. Update documentation as needed
